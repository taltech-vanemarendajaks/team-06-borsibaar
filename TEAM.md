Workflow:
All development is done in feature branches created from main.
Changes are merged into main via pull requests after review.
Pull requests are reviewed by at least one team member.

Merge strategies used:
- Squash & merge : Because we had multiple commits that where very similar
- Regular merge : To keep all commits as they were done by developer

Issues with merge:
- No real issues with merge conflicts
